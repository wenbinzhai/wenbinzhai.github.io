However, due to the complexity of the Internet architecture, there are inevitably some inherent security threats, which could be exploited by adversaries to cause great damage. Moving Target Defense (MTD) has been proposed to solve this problem by building a dynamic, heterogeneous and redundant system architecture. Unfortunately, most of the existing data arbitration algorithms for MTD are based on the majority consensus voting algorithm, which cannot cope with common mode escape. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for moving target defense based on Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL), called FedDA. In addition to the output data of heterogeneous executives, FedDA leverages their behavior data to assist in data arbitration. Meanwhile, we consider a more realistic assumption that the behavior data of heterogeneous executives is not annotated with ground-truth lables, and FSSL is used for model training. Finally, a data arbitration algorithm combined with historical confidence is proposed to identify malicious executives. Extensive experimental results show that our method can well resist common mode escape and outperform the state-of-the-art data arbitration algorithms.","tags":["Moving Target Defense","Federated Semi-Supervised Learning"],"title":"A Framework for Moving Target Defense based on Federated Semi-Supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun Guo","Liang Liu","Wenbin Zhai","Youwei Ding"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1699920000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699920000,"objectID":"b4be2572e91e20557beab134010f9a2a","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/guo-iccc/","publishdate":"2023-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/guo-iccc/","section":"publication","summary":"K-anycast refers to a communication model where a message is transmitted from a source to k destinations. Compared to multicast and unicast, k-anycast offers significant advantages in terms of load balancing, redundancy, and improved reliability. As far as we know, there is currently no research on k-anycast for UAV networks. We propose an Efficient K-anycast Routing scheme called EKR. The high dynamism of UAV networks poses a challenge in formalizing and addressing the k-anycast problem. Therefore, this paper utilizes predetermined trajectory information to construct Encounter Record Tree (ER-Tree), which converts dynamically changing network topologies into a static graph. Based on ER-Tree, we formalize the k-anycast problem in UAV networks and transform it into a Group Steiner Tree problem, which is known to be NP-hard. Then an efficient search algorithm is proposed to solve it and find the transmission path. To evaluate the performance of EKR, we performed simulations with the One simulator. The results demonstrate that EKR outperforms existing protocols in terms of delivery rate, end-to-end delay, and network overhead.","tags":["Wireless Sensor Networks","Routing Optimization"],"title":"EKR: An Efficient K-anycast Routing in UAV Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zixiao Zhou","Liang Liu","Wenbin Zhai","Jiancheng Song","Yulei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1698278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698278400,"objectID":"9f070111de053bc790ba147934ff2c92","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/zhou-cdics/","publishdate":"2023-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/zhou-cdics/","section":"publication","summary":"With the development of microelectronics in recent years, the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been improving continuously. Modern rotary-wing UAVs possess high maneuverability and agility, making them widely applied in mobile crowd sensing (MCS). In order to solve the shortcoming of limited battery capacity and expand the mission area of UAVs, the ground vehicle is introduced as a platform for transportation, launch, recycle, and recharging UAVs. However, existing studies only consider the case of vehicle-assisted homogeneous UAVs. In reality, due to different sensing requirements and UAV hardware, vehicles may need to assist heterogeneous UAVs with different sensors, flight speeds, and battery capacities. In this paper, we formalize and study the vehicle-assisted heterogeneous UAVs path planning problem, and decompose it into three sub-problems, namely detection point allocation, UAV path planning, and vehicle route planning. In order to solve the above problems, we proposes an efficient power-aware path planning algorithm for vehicle-assisted multi-heterogeneous-UAV (VHUPA). In VHUPA, we first design the genetic algorithm to find the allocation scheme of the detection points, then plan flight paths of UAVs at each parking spot according to the allocation scheme, and finally optimize the route of the ground vehicle according to the power consumption of UAVs to minimize the waiting time for charging. Performance evaluation demonstrates that time cost of the VHUPA solution is reduced by more than 21% compared with the existing algorithm.","tags":["Wireless Sensor Networks","Plan Planning"],"title":"Power-Aware Path Planning for Vehicle-Assisted Heterogeneous UAVs in Mobile Crowd Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wanying Lu","Liang Liu","Wenbin Zhai","Haoyuan Chen","Yulei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1697587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697587200,"objectID":"6833b63195d9adf3bbf655e81410e25f","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/lu-ispa/","publishdate":"2023-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/lu-ispa/","section":"publication","summary":"The popularization and application of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought massive time series data, which puts forward higher requirements for data compression technology. At present, most existing compression methods use only a single lossy or lossless compression algorithm to perform data compression. Furthermore, traditional lossy compression methods usually adopt a fixed error threshold. However, in practical applications, users have different accuracy requirements for time series data in different numerical ranges. In this paper, we design a Hybrid Bilayer Compression (HBC) framework, which consists of a data accuracy-aware lossy compression layer and a data feature-aware lossless compression layer. First, the original time series data is lossy compressed on the top layer of HBC, where the error threshold can be adaptively adjusted according to the user's accuracy requirements. Then, based on the features of lossy compressed data, we use supervised learning to select the optimal lossless compression algorithm from the algorithm pool to further compress the data. Experimental results show that compared with three state-of-the-art compression algorithms, HBC reduces the storage space by 52.1%, 91.66%, and 92.27%, respectively.","tags":["Databases"],"title":"HBC: Combining Lossy and Lossless Hybrid Bilayer Compression Framework on Time-Series Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbin Zhai"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1686960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686960000,"objectID":"b912aa60b76841bc17f13efb39d51d33","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/thesis/postgraduatethesis/","publishdate":"2023-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/postgraduatethesis/","section":"publication","summary":"With the development of technologies such as sensors and wireless communications, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) ad-hoc networks have been widely used in military and civilian applications.

This paper introduces a novel type of attack called time-delay attack. The malicious nodes delay packet forwarding by extending the processing time of packets, thus affecting the performance and availability of the network. This attack is very stealthy and difficult to detect because it does not violate any communication protocol. To the best of our knowledge, how to detect the time-delay attack in IoT networks is still an open problem. We first propose a machine learning-based baseline algorithm to detect the time-delay attack. It models the system features of each node and the forwarding time of packets to detect whether a node is malicious or not. However, the baseline algorithm needs to detect all nodes in the network, which causes unnecessary resource consumption. Moreover, using a single model in the baseline algorithm does not have high robustness. To reduce the overhead and improve the detection performance, we design an efficient Detection algorithm based on Node pruning and Model fusion (DNM).

In order to assign tasks to closer workers, it is necessary for workers to provide accurate locations to the server. However, it will result in the leakage of the participants’ location privacy. Existing works provide each worker with the same level of location privacy protection, which cannot meet the different privacy requirements of various workers. In addition, most works assume that the tasks are single-location tasks, and do not consider multi-location tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-location Task Allocation Problem with personalized location privacy protection (MLTAP). As far as we know, we are the first to study MLTAP. We propose a Multi-location task Allocation framework with Personalized location Privacy-protecting (MAPP). In order to allocate tasks efficiently, we use the R-tree to store workers and minimum bounding rectangle to represent multi-location tasks, thus filtering the unreachable workers for tasks. To better eliminate the adverse effect of location confusion, the SC server sorts candidate workers by the ranking metrics and allocates multi-location tasks efficiently. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify that MAPP has good performance in terms of utility.","tags":["Privacy Protection"],"title":"MAPP: An efficient multi-location task allocation framework with personalized location privacy-protecting in spatial crowdsourcing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbin Zhai","Liang Liu","Jianfei Peng","Youwei Ding","Wanying Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1668643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668643200,"objectID":"0ef5e688d2069ddfdd3327abdee3f977","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/par/","publishdate":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/par/","section":"publication","summary":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian scenarios since they are low in cost and flexible in use. They can adapt to a wide variety of dangerous scenarios and complete many tasks the Manned Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) can not undertake. In order to establish connectivity and collect data in large areas, numerous UAVs often cooperate with each other and set up a UAV wireless network. Many multi-hop routing protocols have been proposed to efficiently deliver messages with high delivery ratio and low energy consumption. However, most of them do not consider that the power level of UAVs is adjustable. In this paper, we propose a Power-Aware Routing (PAR) algorithm for UAV networks. PAR utilizes the pre-planned trajectory information of UAVs to compute the encounters at different power levels, and then constructs a power-aware encounter tree to calculate the transmission path with minimum energy consumption from the source to the destination within the delay constraint. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that compared with three classic algorithms, PAR significantly reduces the energy consumption and improves the network performance on the basis of ensuring timely delivery of packets.","tags":["Routing Optimization","Wireless Sensor Networks"],"title":"PAR: A Power-Aware Routing Algorithm for UAV Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunfeng Cui","Wenbin Zhai","Liang Liu","Youwei Ding","Wanying Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1667027116,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667027116,"objectID":"9d9a3a7df1bcf63ee386e7a646e8c346","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/conference-paper/cui-eisa/","publishdate":"2022-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/cui-eisa/","section":"publication","summary":"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), users often submit spatial range queries to obtain statistical information of an area in the network, such as the average temperature and the maximum humidity of an area.

In addition, these algorithms assume that the nodes between the communication radius can perform perfect communication, which is impractical. Aiming to solve these problems, this paper proposes a link aware aggregation query algorithm with privacy-preserving capability, that is, Reliable Spatial Range Data Aggregation Query with Privacy-Preserving (RPSAQ). RPSAQ first divides the query area into multiple sub-areas, and each sub-area is divided into multiple grids according to the network topology and link quality. Under the condition of ensuring node-perceived data privacy, RPSAQ collects sensing data of nodes by traversing the grids in the query area, which not only reduces the packet loss rate and energy consumption of sensor nodes, but also ensures the sensing data’s privacy. The experiment results show that RPSAQ outperforms the existing privacy protection algorithms in terms of packet transmission, energy consumption and query result quality.","tags":["Routing Optimization","Wireless Sensor Networks"],"title":"Link Aware Aggregation Query with Privacy-Preserving Capability in Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gongshun Min","Liang Liu","Wenbin Zhai","Zijie Wang","Wanying Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1662681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662681600,"objectID":"d4041891d773d72e75b8f7a18b055c2e","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/journal-article/min-fgcs/","publishdate":"2022-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/min-fgcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Data collection with mobile agent (MA) can balance the energy consumption of nodes in partitioned wireless sensor networks.

GBA selects RPs by solving the GTSP problem. Furthermore, based on GBA, we take advantage of constructing convex hull to plan a more efficient moving path for MA.

In this paper, we take adjustable charging power into consideration and propose the power level aware charging schedule (PACS) problem, which is proved to be NP-hard. To solve the PACS problem, we discretize the network area into several grids. Then we reformulate PACS as a monotone submodular optimization problem and propose an effective algorithm to solve it.

Due to its distributed nature, IoT is vulnerable to various internal attacks. One of these attacks is the packet-dropping attack, which is very harmful. The existing packet-dropping attack detection algorithms are unsuitable for emerging resource-constrained IoT networks. For example, ML-based algorithms always inject numerous packets to obtain the training dataset. However, it is heavyweight for energy-limited nodes to forward these extra packets. In this paper, we propose a lightweight evidence fusion-based detection algorithm (EFDA), which leverages the packet forwarding evidence to identify malicious nodes. Firstly, EFDA finds the sequence numbers of dropped packets and their corresponding source nodes. Then, it traces the routing path of each dropped packet and collects evidence for detection. The evidence stored by nodes around the path record the node’s forwarding behaviors. Finally, the collected evidence is fused to evaluate the trust of nodes. Based on nodes’ trust, the K-means clustering is used to distinguish between malicious nodes and benign nodes. We conduct simulation experiments to compare EFDA with ML-based algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that EFDA can detect the packet-dropping attack without injecting packets and achieve a higher detection accuracy.","tags":["Cybersecurity","Wireless Sensor Networks"],"title":"Detection of packet dropping attack based on evidence fusion in IoT networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiancheng Song","Liang Liu","Yulei Liu","Jie Xi","Wenbin Zhai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642636800,"objectID":"f54e3e34e54aa3779ce92596e029e16e","permalink":"https://wenbinzhai.github.io/publication/journal-article/song-wcmc/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/song-wcmc/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the capability of fast deployment and controllable mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in mobile crowdsensing (MCS).

However, existing works only consider a special scenario, one ground vehicle with multiple UAVs. In this paper, we consider a more general scenario, multiple ground vehicles with multiple UAVs. We formalize the multi-vehicle-assisted multi-UAV path planning problem, which is a joint route planning and task assignment problem (RPTSP). To solve RPTSP, an efficient multi-vehicle-assisted multi-UAV path planning algorithm (MVP) is proposed. In MVP, we first allocate the detecting points to proper parking spots and then propose an efficient heuristic allocation algorithm EHA to plan the paths of ground vehicles. Besides, a genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning are utilized to plan the paths of UAVs. MVP maximizes the profits of an MCS carrier with a response time constraint and minimizes the number of employed vehicles.

The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rExample inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\rf(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}\r$$\rDiagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
